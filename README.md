# My very first exercises in SQL

## Learning SQL and Tableau for Data Analysis
Starting a bootcamp is exciting! The very first project we did in the bootcamp at WBS Coding school is all about learning SQL and using it to analyse a given data set.
The following scripts, charts, and presentation were created in the first 2 weeks of a Data Science Bootcamp. 
I learned to make queries in MySQL Workbench, create charts in Tableau based on the insights I gained from my queries, and finally got to work on 
and present the results with my teammate to the rest of the group.

The topic of the project was: should a well established European company that sells high-end apple product accessories use the warehouse and delivery services of a big Brazilian company
to expand into the Brazilian market. The fictiotious scenario takes place in 2018, long before Covid and AI-Chat bots.

I am looking forward to polishing some of the queries abit further and practicing more in SQL.
