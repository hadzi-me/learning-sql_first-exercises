# My very first exercises in SQL

## Learning SQL and Tableau for Data Analysis
Starting a bootcamp is exciting! The *very first* project we did in the Data Science bootcamp at WBS Coding school is all about learning SQL and using it to analyse a given data set.
The following scripts, charts, and presentation were created in the first 2 weeks of the bootcamp. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The topic of the project was: should a well established European company that sells high-end apple products and product accessories use the warehouse and delivery services of a big Brazilian company
to expand into the Brazilian market. The *fictitious* scenario takes place in <ins>2018</ins>, long before Covid and AI-Chat bots.

### Programmes used
I learned to make queries in **MySQL Workbench**, create charts in **Tableau** based on the insights I gained from my queries, and finally got to work on 
and present the results with my teammate to the rest of the group in a **Canva** presentation.

### Tasks to accomplish
- [x] go over all the theory in our LMS to learn about SQL and its functions
- [x] install and get familiar with MySQL Workbench
- [x] try first queries and look through data
- [x] start the analyis by answering business questions about our fictitious use case 
- [x] gather the insights from the different queries and visualise it using Tableau
- [ ] do not start hating Tableau because it has almost too many options
- [x] prepare and practice a presentation with your charts and arguments in Canva
